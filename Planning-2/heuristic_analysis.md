# AIND Planning - Heuristic Analysis

In this document we analyze the performance of different searching algorithms on three similar planning problems. All three planning problems deal with cargo transportation, but have different start and goal states.  Each problem consists of airports, planes, and cargos, of which there are a different combinations of each.

**Part 1** analyzes the performance of _uninformed planning searches_ (non-heuristic based planning) on the cargo transportation problems.

**Part 2** analyzes the performance of the A* search algorithm, using domain independent heuristics on the same problems as in Part 1, but this time using a _planning graph_ for node expansion and cost estimation.

## The problems

Three initial state spaces are defined, stipulating at which airport each plane is, and at which airport each cargo is. These three different problems are referred to as `air_cargo_p1`, `air_cargo_p2` and `air_cargo_p3`.

Each problem has an optimal solution. We will use this to compare the optimality of the various searching algorithms.

See the _Problems Definition_ section at the end of the document for a full description of the start state, goal state and optimal solution of each problem.


## Part 1 - Uninformed heuristic analysis

In this section, we compare the performance of various _uninformed_ search algorithms. An _uninformed search algorithm_ is one that does not have access to any information other than the definition of the problem, and the ability to distinguish the present state from a goal state.  

These search algorithms will be evaluated in terms of:
* **Expansions**: Number of nodes expanded to find the Solution
* **Goal Tests**: Number of states tested for a goal state
* **Plan Length**: The length of the solution
* **Optimality**: Is the optimal solution found?
* **Execution Time**: Time (in seconds) it took to find the proposed solution

### Analysis

From the results above, we can see that `depth_first_graph_search` and `greedy_best_first_graph_search` consistently outperform other searching algorithms in terms of expansions, goal tests and execution time. However, these algorithms do not provide an optimal solution to the problem. We can see that `breadth_first_search` and `uniform_cost_search` are the only algorithms that do provide an optimal solution.

Thus, if the requirement is to have the **shortest execution time**, and the **minimum number of expanded nodes**, the `depth_first_graph_search` algorithm is recommended for solving the air cargo planning problems. If the requirement is to have an **optimal solution** in the **least amount of time** and using **minimum memory**, the `breadth_first_search` algorithm is recommended. Although `uniform_cost_search` solves problem 3 in a shorter time, `breadth_first_search` solves problems 1 and 2 in a shorter time and would thus be our recommendation.

The motivation for the recommendations above can be confirmed by comparing the theoretical time and computational complexity, as well the completeness of an algorithm, using the following table, adapted from Peter& Norvig 3rd edition, section 3.4.7:

| Search Method                  | Time Complexity | Computational Complexity |  Complete?  |
|--------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|
| breadth_first_search           | $O(b^d)$   | $O(b^d)$   | Yes        |
| depth_first_graph_search       | $O(b^m)$   |  $O(bm)$   | No         |
| uniform_cost_search            | $O(b^{1 + [C^*/\epsilon]})$ | $O(b^{1 + [C^*/\epsilon]})$   | Yes        |
| greedy_best_first_graph_search | $O(b^m)$   | $O(b^m)$   | No         |
> Where b is the branching factor, d is the depth of the shallowest solution, m is the maximum depth of the search tree, C* is the cost of the optimal solution, and $\epsilon$ is the step cost.


## Part 2 - Informed heuristic analysis

In this section we analyze the performance of the A* search algorithm using three different _informed_ heuristics - heuristics which enable the algorithm to deduce some information about the current state, other than if it is a goal state or not.

The three heuristics that we will compare are:
* h_1 - Always return 1 (not a true informed heuristic, but used a benchmark for A* search)
* h_ignore_preconditions - Ignore the preconditions of the Actions
* h_pg_levelsum - Compute the sum of the levels at which each goal appears on the graph.

### Analysis

From the data above, we can see that A* with `h_pg_levelsum` outperforms the rest, but unfortunately cannot calculate a solution within 10 minutes on problem 3, and thus we cannot consider this heuristic.

As for the other 2 heuristics, naturally `h_ignore_preconditions` is faster and more memory efficient than `h_1`, however, this heuristic is not practical in my opinion, because (as it states) it ignores some mechanics of the problem and is thus not feasible in reality.
